## Background

[Adam Myers](https://github.com/ANMyers) and I built the application during the frontend portion of our course at [Nashville Software School] (http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/). The assignment was a group challenge in the curriculum that no group in previous cohorts had yet to complete. We did. And as you can see in the code, it was a wild process. We built it over a weekend and left a code base that is unruly and sparsely commented. But the game works, which was the goal of the challenge.

I leave this code on my GitHub profile as a memorial. 

First, I want to recognize the motivation that comes in a challenge and the wisdom that can come from a collection of diverse people. Adam and I could not be more different. He, a United States Marine and former diesel generator mechanic. I, a Yale-trained PhD and one-time New Testament scholar. Neither of us could have finished the project alone. 

Second, I want to highlight the difficulty that a lack of organization can cause for others. [Taylor Perkins](https://github.com/taylorperkins) also contributed to the project. But we looped him in after we had already moved pretty far into the project. Because neither Adam nor I had the skills at the time to plan our application, we could never fully involve Taylor. His code is the most organized of the bunch, that which takes the 800-line JavaScript monster that Adam and I created, breaking it out into intelligible units with [IIFEs](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/). The project would have been much more successful had Adam and I been capable of thinking beyond our excitement at the possibility of completing a challenge none of our predecessors had.
